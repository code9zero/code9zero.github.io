# My private static webpage

I migrated from my self-managed hosting to GitHub Pages for convenience reasons.
Below you find the original readme text from HTML5 UP.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
